/// 
/// This action compute the drag and worldposition of the mouse (or any position on screen)
/// It assumes the following: 
/// -- Enter this action ( State ) when the drag is supposed to start.
/// -- quit this action when the drag is suppose to finish.
/// 
/// currently. It accomodates groundplane point changes to have a consistent drag computation if the camera is moving while you drag.
/// NOTE: this is not the best way. the plance normal changes is not taken in consideration ( and so is the camera rotation ). 
/// IMPROVEMENTS: ideally, the plane should be defines as a transform, and the drag expressed in that transform reference to allow full flexibility
/// if camera or plane is rotated during the drag. GEt in touch with me if you need that improvement and did not succeed in trying yourself to implement it.
/// 
/// If camera is not defined, it will use the camera it is attached to or as a last resort the main camera.
